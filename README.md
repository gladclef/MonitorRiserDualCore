# Neopixel-Monitor-Riser-ESP32
A controller with several patterns of light that fits underneith my monitor riser. The goal was to maintain a simple interface that will eventually result in a nice clean setup.

It uses the two cores on the ESP32 to monitor a rotary encoder and manage the neopixel lights. The original project which used two arduinos to accomplish this task is at https://github.com/gladclef/NeoPixel-Monitor-Riser.
